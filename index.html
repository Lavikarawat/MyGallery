            data-info="The Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo da Vinci, is a renowned portrait of a woman with an enigmatic smile. It's considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, and is the most famous, visited, and written-about work of art in the world.

It portrays Shakuntala â€” a character from Kalidasaâ€™s Sanskrit play *Abhijnanashakuntalam* â€” pretending to remove a thorn from her foot while secretly turning to glance at her lover, King Dushyanta.
        Ravi Varma's genius lies in blending Western oil painting techniques with Indian mythological themes. His portrayal of Indian women, especially Shakuntalaâ€™s graceful pose and soft expression, gave a romantic and human dimension to Indian epics and legends.">
